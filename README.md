This purpose of this game is to create a children's game designed to introduce children to computer science and teach them a simple but useful method to guess a number in an effective manner. The game is broken into two seperate parts--the computer guesses the children's number, and the children guess a number selected by the computer. The former is meant to show/teach the children how to use Binary Search and the latter is meant to give the children a method to practice the search algorithm.
